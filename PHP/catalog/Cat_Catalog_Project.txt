This is a my catalog project for DMIT- 2025 PHP

This project will represent different cats and their breeds, a collection of my favourites have been added to the database.
I've inserted cats from all over the globe, but most of them come from North America.
All the information is currently already inside the DB, more will be added once the catalog project continues.
The home page will display a list of the cats, and be filtered by links on the side.
All this will be administered by a secured admin section (eventually). This will allow the admin to preform CRUD operations on the DB table.

Breed: Abyssinian
Origin: Egypt
